#+TITLE: Divine Is Not Evil â€” Modal editing in Emacs, with text objects or something close enough.

Divine is a lightweight and extensible modal interface for Emacs, with
support for Vi-like text objects, but designed to integrate naturally with
Emacs.

* Basic usage

Divine comes with a simple tutorial.   To get started, put Divine somewhere in your =load-path=, then evaluate:

  (require 'divine)
  (info "(Eintr) Preface")
#+end_src
